# DQN for Autonomous

## Deep Q-Learning
> Unlike policy gradient methods, which attempt to learn functions which directly map an observation to an action, Q-Learning attempts to learn the value of being in a given state, and taking a specific action there.

## Experiment
To create a conda environment including required packages:

```bash
make
```

To connect to the simulator:
```bash
python server.py
```
